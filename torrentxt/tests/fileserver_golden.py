"""fileserver_golden.py - pure-Python reference for the security- and
correctness-critical logic of Quick Share's FOLDER web server (the browsable
directory page served over the onion when a folder is shared with Tor on, and
over the clearweb link), in examples/torrent-quickshare.livecodescript.

OXT cannot compile/run .livecodescript headlessly, so - exactly like
onion_frame_golden.py and record_golden_test.py - this PINS the parts of the
folder server that are verifiable off-engine: the HTTP byte-range parser, the
path-traversal decision, the dotfile and reserved-namespace refusals, the
static pipeline's whole decision, the listing, the MIME mapping, and the HTML
escaper. If this and the .livecodescript ever disagree, one of them is wrong.

Mirrors these LiveCodeScript handlers:
  qsFsParseRange  -> parse_range()      (RFC 7233 single-range; 416 on out-of-range)
  qsFsServePath   -> traversal_ok()     (".." refused after urlDecode + \\ -> /)
  qsHasDotSegment -> has_dot_segment()  (a dot-leading segment does not exist; nocloud's
                                         round-5 guard, ported 2026-09-27)
  qsHttpReservedPath -> reserved_path() (/_qs and /_edit are the route layer's; folded on
                                         purpose; nocloud's, ported 2026-09-27)
  qsFsServePath + qsCwServe -> serve_static() (the whole static decision over a tree: the
                                         route, 405, reserved 404, 503, dotfile 404, folder
                                         redirect / index / listing, file, SPA, 404)
  qsFsListing     -> listing_visible()  (the names a listing shows: no dot-leading entry)
  qsEditWriteRoute -> edit_write_decision() (the editor's WRITE refusals, in order:
                                         confinement, a hidden path, a folder)
  qsFsMime        -> mime()
  qsFsIcon        -> fs_icon()          (directory-listing icon/colour type token)
  qsFsHtmlEscape  -> html_escape()
  qsCwServe       -> capability_route() (clearweb: the /<token>/ capability gate)
  qsSiteSpaTarget -> spa_is_route()     (SPA fallback: a route vs a missing asset)
  qsHttpHeaderEnd -> http_header_end()  (byte index of the CRLFCRLF head terminator)
  qsHttpReqComplete -> http_req_complete() (head + Content-Length body received?)
  qsJsonEscape    -> json_escape()      (the /_qs/info route's JSON value escaping)
  qsEditSafePath  -> edit_safe_path()   (web-editor WRITE-path confinement - linchpin)
  qsEditIsLocal   -> edit_is_local()    (web-editor LAN-first gate - the other linchpin)
  qsQueryParam    -> query_param()      (editor read/write ?path= extraction)
  qsHexKey        -> hex_key()          (lowercase hex of the UTF-8 bytes: a key no case
                                         fold can merge; 2026-09-25)
  qsRouteKey      -> route_key()        (the case-exact route-table key: the hex of
                                         "METHOD /path", the method upper-cased)
  qsRouteLookupKey -> route_lookup_key() (the key a request DISPATCHES to, or "": a HEAD
                                         falls back to the GET route; GET /_EDIT is not the
                                         /_edit route. WORK-PLAN torrentxt #18, 2026-09-25)

EVERY mirror here names a handler the demo has, and tools/check-script-vectors.py holds
each to the SHIPPED demo through the family interpreter, on these rows (since
2026-09-27; until then only the route section was driven, and five mirrors copied
from nocloud's golden named nocloud handlers this demo never had: has_dot_segment,
which now has its handler, and http_req_length, file_size_probe, safe_filename and
rate_short / eta_short, which were deleted here and stay pinned in nocloud's golden,
against nocloud's script). The route section fills the demo's table through its own
qsHttpRoute, so the subscript the engine folds is the interpreter's folded one; the
serve rows run the demo's real qsFsServePath and qsCwServe over a real folder built
from SERVE_TREE.
