House style: no em-dashes (hyphens, commas, colons, parentheses). ASCII only in `.lcb` /
`.livecodescript`, even in comments and strings. Comment the *why*, densely; match the surrounding style.

## What this is

**CoinXT** is a Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptography layer for OpenXTalk (OXT). It wraps **trezor-crypto**
(MIT, plain C, no external deps, the crypto core of a hardware wallet) behind a thin C ABI and a
livecodescript API, so an xTalk app can make keys, derive HD wallets from a mnemonic, build addresses,
and sign and verify for both chains. It adds no cryptography of its own; every curve op and hash is
trezor-crypto's.

```
app (livecodescript)
   |
CoinXT public API (cx*)   src/coinxt.livecodescript
   |- encodings in SCRIPT: hex, Base58Check, Bech32/Bech32m, RLP, xprv/xpub, WIF, EIP-55, addresses
   |- FFI seam: one .lcb module, unsafe ... end unsafe around every foreign call
CoinXT C shim (cnx_)   native/coinxt.c  +  vendored trezor-crypto subset
   |- curve + hashes in C: secp256k1 (ECDSA/recoverable/recover/ECDH/Schnorr),
      SHA2/SHA3/Keccak-256/RIPEMD-160, HMAC, PBKDF2, BIP-32 node math, BIP-39 seed
```

## How CoinXT differs from its siblings (read before you assume)

1. **Unlike OnionXT, CoinXT HAS a C shim, and it is central.** OnionXT is pure script over engine
   sockets; its FFI section is carried "just in case." CoinXT's whole point is the shim, so the
   **FFI/C-ABI conventions below are law from day one**, and every shim change builds under ASan + UBSan
   and bumps the ABI + `cxCheckABI()` on any ABI change (the SodiumXT / TorrentXT discipline).
2. **Unlike OnionXT, CoinXT does no I/O and holds no long-lived state.** No sockets, no daemon, no accept
   loop, no lifecycle. Every call is a pure, synchronous, deterministic function: bytes in, bytes out.
   The async/state-machine discipline OnionXT needed does NOT apply. There is nothing to close.
3. **Like SodiumXT, CoinXT is bytes-in / bytes-out crypto, and composes it.** It is closest to SodiumXT
   in shape (a stateless crypto wrap), but it wraps a different C library and covers a different domain
   (coin curves, hashes, HD wallets, address formats).
4. **CoinXT handles money.** A wrong byte is not a bug report, it is lost funds. Every rule below that
   says "fail closed" or "verify the checksum" or "compose audited code, never hand-roll" counts double.

## The rules that make this safe and correct

1. **Add no cryptography. Wrap trezor-crypto.** Every scalar multiply, signature, and hash is upstream,
   audited code. A missing primitive is a new vendored file or an upstream request, never a hand-rolled
   curve op or hash here. There is no CoinXT cipher.
2. **The app owns key custody; CoinXT is a calculator.** CoinXT holds a key only for the microseconds of
   one operation. Storage, backup, and confirm-before-sign are the app's. Document the boundary loudly.
3. **Sign only the exact digest the app hands you.** `cxSign` takes a 32-byte hash. CoinXT does not build
   your sighash / transaction preimage in the primitive layer, and even in the tx-building phase the app
   confirms the decoded human intent. A blind signer is a footgun.
4. **Fail closed on every malformed input.** A bad Base58Check / Bech32 / EIP-55 checksum, an
   out-of-range scalar, a wrong-length buffer, a non-canonical signature: return a clean `"CoinXT: ..."`
   error, never a wrong-but-plausible key or address. Verify every checksum on decode.
5. **Secret hygiene across the FFI (see below).** Private keys, seeds, chaincodes cross as `Data` /
   `Pointer`, are `memzero`ed in the shim after use, and are NEVER returned as a bridged C string. The
   script layer clears its own key variables the moment it is done, and the docs state the honest limit
   (OXT script variables are not locked memory).
6. **Deterministic by design.** RFC 6979 signing needs no randomness; fresh key material comes from the
   caller (compose SodiumXT `sxRandomBytes`). No ambient RNG in the shim. Every operation is a pure
   function of its inputs, so every operation is KAT-testable.

## Commands

**Static gate for the script layer** (carried verbatim from OnionXT / SodiumXT; the checkers ship in
THIS project's `tools/` so CoinXT is self-contained when it moves to its own repository):
```sh
python3 tools/check-livecodescript.py
python3 tools/check-docs-style.py
```
It checks smart/curly quotes, em/en dashes, block balance, constants-before-use, the prefixed-token
shadow trap, the `put ... into ... after` malformation, and (for `.lcb`) a missing
`use com.livecode.foreign` and `textEncode`/`textDecode` used inside a module.

**The C shim builds under sanitizers** (from phase 1):
```sh
cc -Wall -Wextra -fsanitize=address,undefined -isystem <trezor-crypto-dir> \
   native/coinxt.c <vendored .c files> -shared -o coinxt.<ext>
```
Treat trezor-crypto headers as system headers (`-isystem`) so their warnings do not pollute `-Wall
-Wextra`. Bump `cnx_abi_version()` + the `.lcb` `cxCheckABI()` on every ABI change.

**Known-answer vectors** (the correctness net for a money library):
```sh
python3 tools/coin-kat.py --check
```
Every deterministic path is pinned to a PUBLIC vector (RFC 6979, BIP-32/39, BIP-173/350, EIP-55,
Keccak), cross-checked against an independent implementation before pinning. A signature CoinXT makes
must also verify in a mainstream library, not just in CoinXT.

**There is no headless way to compile or run `.livecodescript` on OXT.** So a script change is "designed
and statically reasoned; needs an on-engine pass" until it has loaded the real `.lcb` in an engine and
round-tripped the `cx*` calls. The shim, by contrast, IS testable headless (the KAT harness can call it).

## The C-vs-script split (hold this line)

Anything that touches a private key or a curve point is **C** (audited trezor-crypto). Anything that is
checksummed byte-shuffling with no secret-dependent branch is **livecodescript**, pinned by a KAT. This
keeps the trusted native surface tiny (about 25 buffer-in / buffer-out functions, SPEC section 5.1) and
puts hex / Base58Check / Bech32 / RLP / address composition where they are easy to read, diff, and test,
exactly as OnionXT does base32 in script. Do NOT push encodings into the shim to "keep it together", and
do NOT re-implement a curve op in script to "avoid the FFI".

## FFI / C-ABI conventions (LAW here, not carried-for-later)

The single most expensive thing the family has learned. Change nothing here without a very good reason.

- **Byte buffers cross as `Pointer` + `CInt` length. An LCB `Data` does NOT auto-bridge to `void*`** (it
  marshals as an opaque `MCDataRef`). An **out** buffer is a raw block from the engine `<builtin>`
  `MCMemoryAllocate`, passed as a real `Pointer`; the shim writes into it and returns bytes written, or
  `-needed` (negative required size) when the block is too small, and the LCB layer re-allocates, retries,
  and copies back with `MCDataCreateWithBytes`. An **in** buffer passes `MCDataGetBytePtr(theData)` plus
  its length.
- **`MCMemoryAllocate`'s size is C `size_t`, so it marshals as `UIntSize`, NOT `CUInt`.** A 4-byte int
  into an 8-byte size slot on a 64-bit build corrupts the heap.
- **There is no 64-bit foreign int.** A value that can exceed 2^31 (a PBKDF2 iteration count is fine at
  32-bit; a satoshi amount is not) crosses as a decimal `ZStringUTF8` string, parsed in the shim.
- **Reals cross as `double`, booleans as `int` (0/1).** Exported symbols keep the stable `cnx_` prefix
  and are NEVER renamed once shipped (the `.lcb` `binds to` strings reference them by name; a rename is a
  silent bind failure at load). `<builtin>` handlers resolve by name, so no leading underscore.
- **Never RETURN a bridged C string** (`ZStringUTF8` / `NativeCString`) from a foreign handler: the
  engine adopts the returned pointer and later `free()`s it, so a static or library-owned return is
  free()-on-static, heap corruption on the first call. This is doubly dangerous with key material. Fill a
  caller buffer and return length / `-needed`.
- **Pass a null pointer only through an `optional Pointer`** parameter (e.g. an absent BIP-340 aux_rand);
  a plain `Pointer` rejects `nothing`.
- **Bump the ABI version on any ABI change**, and have `cxCheckABI()` throw a clear "reinstall CoinXT"
  error on skew instead of corrupting memory on first use. Expose every length constant from the shim as
  a function (`cnx_seckey_len` = 32, ...); never hardcode a size in LCB.
- **`textEncode` / `textDecode` are NOT available to an LCB module** (livecodescript only), so bytes
  cross as `Data` and text<->Data conversion stays in the livecodescript layer.
- **`unsafe ... end unsafe` brackets every foreign call**, and keep all `local` declarations at the TOP
  of the handler (a nested `local` has broken whole-script compilation). **`use com.livecode.foreign`**
  whenever a foreign type is named.

## Determinism and entropy

- **No RNG in the shim.** trezor-crypto requires an integrator `random_buffer` / `random32`; wire it to
  ABORT (nothing should call it once signing is RFC 6979 and keys come from the caller). A called RNG is
  then a loud bug, not a silent weak key.
- **Fresh key material is the caller's.** `cxNewSeckey(pEntropy32)` validates 32 caller-supplied bytes
  (from SodiumXT `sxRandomBytes`, or OS entropy). Seeds and mnemonics are deterministic from there.
- Because everything is a pure function of its inputs, the whole surface is pinned by `tools/coin-kat.py`.
  If a result is not reproducible, something is wrong.

## Secret hygiene

- Private keys / seeds / chaincodes: `Data` in, `Data`/`Pointer` across the FFI, `memzero`ed in the shim
  after the operation, never a returned bridged string. The `cx*` layer does `put empty into tSeckey` as
  soon as it is done with one.
- **Honest limit, documented:** OXT script variables are not locked (mlock) memory, so a seed held in
  script can be paged to disk. CoinXT on a general-purpose desktop is not hardware-wallet isolation; do
  not market it as such. The trust boundary is the machine.
- Do not log key material. Do not put a seckey or a seed in an error string, a status message, or a
  committed test fixture (KATs use PUBLIC test-vector keys only, which are burned and safe to publish).

## Encodings in script (the OnionXT base32 discipline)

- **Byte discipline:** build with `numToByte` / `binaryEncode`, parse with `byteToNum` / `binaryDecode`
  (a FUNCTION that fills an out var: `get binaryDecode(...)`), index with `byte x to y of`. Never `char`
  / `line` / `word` on binary. Keep a base32/base58/bech32 bit-buffer small and masked each step so a
  long payload never builds a > 2^53 integer (precision loss). Route integer div/mod through helpers and
  avoid `^` in a compound expression (some OXT parsers reject it).
- **Verify every checksum on decode and fail closed:** Base58Check's 4-byte double-SHA-256 tail,
  Bech32/Bech32m's polymod (constant 1 vs 0x2bc830a3, SegWit v0 vs v1+), EIP-55's mixed case. A corrupt
  address must be rejected, never coerced.
- **Keccak-256 is NOT SHA3-256.** Ethereum uses the original `0x01` padding; FIPS-202 uses `0x06`. Two
  different shim functions (`cnx_keccak256` vs `cnx_sha3_256`); never alias them. This is the classic
  Ethereum footgun.
- Pin every encoding to its public vector (BIP-173/350 including INVALID cases, EIP-55 examples, the RLP
  yellow-paper examples).

## LiveCodeScript / LCB / OXT gotchas (carried; see [templates/CLAUDE.md](templates/CLAUDE.md) for the full list)

The generic list applies verbatim. The ones most likely to bite CoinXT:
- No smart/curly quotes anywhere (fails OXT compilation).
- The prefixed-token-shadow trap (`t/p/s/k` name whose full spelling is a reserved token); the checker's
  `RESERVED` set is only as complete as we keep it - add any new one found on-engine.
- Operators that look like functions: `bitAnd`/`bitOr` are operators; `binaryDecode`/`binaryEncode` are
  functions that fill an out var; `^` may be rejected in a compound expression.
- `is a <type>` has no `is a string`; commands report via `the result`, functions return a value.
- A whole `.livecodescript` compiles as a unit; a syntax error in one handler breaks the file.

## Handles and long-lived state

CoinXT is stateless: there is nothing to open, close, or free. The BIP-32 HD node crosses the ABI as a
**fixed-size opaque byte blob** (version || depth || fingerprint || child || chaincode || key), NOT as a
handle into a C-side table, so no generation-tagged handle machinery is needed. Keep it that way; if a
future feature ever needs C-side state, use SodiumXT's generation-tagged handle-table pattern (positive
32-bit ints, 0 invalid, a stale handle a clean error), never a raw pointer through script.

## Testing and conformance

- Pin every deterministic path with a PUBLIC known-answer vector in `tools/coin-kat.py`, cross-checked
  against an independent implementation (Python `ecdsa` / `eth-utils` / `pycryptodome`) BEFORE pinning.
- The gold standard for a signing test: a signature CoinXT produces VERIFIES in a mainstream external
  library, and an HD wallet from a standard mnemonic reproduces a reference address byte for byte.
- Ship a demo and a pure offline self-test harness formatted like OnionXT's (sPass/sFail, KAT sections,
  a section that SKIPS rather than fails when an optional dependency is absent).

## Git / workflow

- Develop on a per-task branch; commit there, open a **draft PR** if none exists. Do not push to `main`
  without explicit permission.
- A script change is "done" once the static gates pass and it has had (or is clearly flagged as needing)
  an on-engine pass. A shim change is "done" once it builds clean under ASan + UBSan, the KATs pass, and
  the ABI + `cxCheckABI()` are bumped in the SAME change.
- A change that ships a native binary refreshes the committed per-platform binary AND a
  `MANIFEST.sha256` in the same change (the SodiumXT model). Vendored trezor-crypto files are third-party
  code: record the upstream commit and any local patch in `VENDOR.md`; hash the sources and the wordlist
  in the manifest; never edit a vendored file in place silently.
- A change that needs a new SodiumXT primitive (e.g. a specific KDF) splits: the upstream feature lands
  first, then CoinXT composes it.
- **No em-dashes** in committed prose or docs. Comment the *why*, densely.

## As-built notes

Record on-engine and cross-library results here as they are learned: the exact trezor-crypto commit
vendored, any upstream quirk, the confirmed accepted-key formats, and each `VERIFY:` promoted to fact
once a CoinXT signature verifies externally.

**Phase 1, hash slice - DONE and verified (2026-07-02).** The FFI/build pipeline is proven end to end:

- Vendored the trezor-crypto SHA-3 unit (`sha3.c/h`, `memzero.c/h`, `byte_order.h`, `options.h`) at
  commit `230cfe37e4c5fefb6ca117725d261a7b3646a995` (see `native/vendor/VENDOR.md`; MIT `LICENSE`
  shipped). Note `byte_order.h` is header-only (there is no `byte_order.c` upstream; a fetch of it 404s).
- `native/coinxt.c` exposes `cnx_abi_version`, `cnx_keccak256`, `cnx_sha3_256`, and the length functions.
  It builds via `native/build.sh` (a plain shared lib for ctypes/LCB, and an ASan+UBSan self-test).
- Verified: the ASan/UBSan self-test runs clean; `cnx_keccak256` matches the published Ethereum vectors
  (`keccak256("")` = `c5d2...a470`), `cnx_sha3_256` matches Python `hashlib` (NIST FIPS-202), and the two
  are provably distinct (the Keccak-vs-SHA3 footgun guarded in `tools/coin-kat.py`).
- `tools/coin-kat.py --check` builds from source and runs the vectors headless (`self-check OK`). This is
  the CoinXT analogue of OnionXT's KAT harness; it grows with each phase.

Still to do in phase 1: nothing native-side for hashes; the `.lcb` foreign module (the on-engine binding)
is written and confirmed in a later step, since it needs a real OXT engine to load. Next up (phase 2):
the secp256k1 curve surface (keypair, ECDSA, recoverable, recover, ECDH), with a signature that must
verify in an independent library.

**Repo-prep - self-contained for the split (2026-07-07).** CoinXT no longer reaches outside its own
directory for anything; it is ready to become the root of its own repository (the procedure and the
post-split checklist are in [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md)):

- The static gates (`tools/check-livecodescript.py`, `tools/check-docs-style.py`) are carried verbatim
  into `tools/`, alongside `tools/coin-kat.py`. Every `../` reference in the docs was retargeted.
- The portable xTalk/LCB lesson book is carried at `templates/CLAUDE.md`, synced byte-identical with
  OnionXT's copy at fork time (including the newest on-engine lessons: the `the detailedFiles` "bad
  factor", the unchecked `accept connections` bind failure, the CRLF returned by `read ... until crlf`,
  and the streaming no-quantifier read). After the split each repo maintains its own copy, the family
  pattern; keep appending to the living-gotcha log.
- CI ships at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: both static gates, the vendored-source `MANIFEST.sha256`
  check, `coin-kat.py --check` (builds the shim from source, drives it via ctypes), and the ASan/UBSan
  self-test. It is dormant while CoinXT is nested (GitHub reads only the repo root's `.github/`) and
  goes live on the split.
- `native/MANIFEST.sha256` pins every vendored trezor-crypto file now, ahead of the packaging phase
  (release binaries join it there). Refresh it in the same change as any vendor re-pin.
