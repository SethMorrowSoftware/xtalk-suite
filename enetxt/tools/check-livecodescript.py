"""check-livecodescript.py - the static gate for the script layer (plan §8.4).

OXT is a GUI runtime: there is NO headless way to compile or run .lcb /
.livecodescript. So we catch what is statically catchable and let the human do
the OXT pass for the rest. This checker enforces, across every .lcb and example:

  1. No smart / curly quotes anywhere (U+2018/2019/201C/201D) - even in a
     comment or string they fail OXT compilation. ASCII " and ' only.
  2. Balanced strings (no stray unterminated " on a logical line).
  3. Balanced blocks: handler/if/repeat (+ unsafe in .lcb; switch/try in
     .livecodescript), matched by kind, with line numbers on mismatch.
  4. Every `unsafe ... end unsafe` bracket balanced (.lcb) - every foreign call
     must be wrapped.
  5. Constants declared before first use (.lcb) - OXT resolves constants by
     lexical position; a forward reference silently evaluates to nothing.
  6. No prefixed name that spells a reserved token (both dialects) - e.g. `tExt`
     is t-e-x-t = `text`, which xTalk evaluates as the keyword, not a variable.

It is a lexer-level checker, NOT a compiler: it neutralizes comments and strings
and reasons about block keywords. It errs toward NOT raising false positives;
where a construct is ambiguous statically it is skipped (documented inline).
